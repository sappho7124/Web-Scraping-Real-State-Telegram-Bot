# Kumi, the real state web scraping telegram bot
**NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS NOT BEING ACTIVELY MAINTAINED, CODE MAY BE OUTDATED**

Kumi is a telegram bot designed to scrape prices of real state website and display them in the chat according to certain criteria given by the user, its meant to be used with a SQL database, the logic to process the database is already in place but for the sake of simplicity (and being able to run it easily) the database is managed locally.

This project consists of basically two parts, KUMI, the telegram bot (Front-end) and the web scraping script and database manager (Back-end), both can be run locally but with slight modifications they can be run in a server.

Any code or data in this project can be used freely by anyone.
